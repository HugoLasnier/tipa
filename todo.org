* TODO [#A] TIPA: Add a symbolic description for a terminal rule
  <2020-02-14 ven.>

  - When an error in a sequential rule is detected, print the name of
    the rule. For example: 

    "@[10:5] list a, b, c;"
    "        -----^" 
    "Error 123: Expecting {", 

    In case of a simple rule that accepts a string, by default the
    name of the rule is the same as the string.  In case of a token,
    it is not the case to print the regular expression, so we can add
    a symbolic name.


* TODO [#C] TIPA: Reduce error noise

  Change the interface to the error reporting. It must be possible to
  eliminate some previous reporting errors, or to "resume" them. 

  For example, in case of alternate rule, we could simply print the
  following:

  "@[10: ] 123 $ 234" 
  "        ----^"
  "Error 124: Unrecongnized token, expecting:" 
  " '+', '-', '*', '/' " 

  Right now, it prints a lot of stuff (one for each possible terminal
  rule in the alternative).
